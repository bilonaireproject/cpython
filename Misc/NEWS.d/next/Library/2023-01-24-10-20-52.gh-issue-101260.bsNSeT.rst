In Python 3.10 a change was made that enhanced the performance of the zlib,
bz2 and lzma modules when operating on large (multiple megabytes) in-memory
buffers. However this came at the cost of a performance degradation for
smaller buffers. Since smaller buffers are used more often, particularly
during streaming, the change was reverted.
